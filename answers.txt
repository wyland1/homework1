What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is to combine multiple versions together to further development (usually done with teams). A rebase is to rewrite a previous version (linear).

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repository that is hosted on a server/network. It allows for multiple versions of a project and all local repos do not directly affect the remote.
